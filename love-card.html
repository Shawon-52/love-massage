    <h1> I love you Kona!</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>You probably wonder why I love you…
      <br>
      And that’s ok.
      <br>
      What you really don’t know is that I ask myself that question every single day. Every day  I find new reasons for loving you even more. It’s sad that you don’t love me the same way but this feeling is awesome and I won’t stop.
      <br>
      Thank you for everything that you are doing for me.
      <br>
      <br>
      Truly yours ,
      Shawon.
    </p>
